Jim Mlodgenski on using [Enums] in place of references to small lookup tables:

I've been a big fan of Enums since Andrew and Tom Dunstan released a patch for
them during the PostgreSQL 8.2 era. Today they're a core feature, and as of
9.1, you can even modify their values! You're missing out if you're not using
them yet.
